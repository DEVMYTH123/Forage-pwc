# Forage-pwc
Job Simulation by PWC Switzerland brought by Forage.

Forage is an online platform which provides job simulations for particular companies in almost every domain. So i picked up my first job sim in PWC.
It was about a case where we have found out that a site has vulnerability issues and we have to identify the risks involved and give apt solutions for the same.
Throughly enjoyed the whole pathway, learnt a lot of things in the 4 tasks that we were handed over.
# Tasks
1.Gain experience in understanding and explaining the concept of integrated defense.
2.Integrat defense strategies and their application in real-world scenarios.
3.Conduct risk assessments and formulat security recommendations for a client.
4.Demonstrat proficiency in cybersecurity terminology, network segmentation, and firewall configuration.

Thanks again to Forage for giving me this chance!
